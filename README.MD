#NoNews App

This is my project for the `Web Development Class` for college. Mainly it is a `CRUD` with a login based on some user filters like:

* `Admin` - that dude that can delete/edit other's accounts.
* `Editor` - this is the dude that can add/edit articles.
* `User` - can add comments. Nothing more.
* `Unregistred` - enough said.

The purpose of this app is to develop coding skills in the [ASP.NET](http://asp.net) framework.
